Qualitative measurements of wine are dependent on many factors that difficult to understand. This project applies machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between these factors and the qualitative quality metric. Various machine learning models are evaluated against each other on a dataset of white wine quality which provides training data that connects white wine quality with quantitative measurements such as citric acid and pH. From the resulting models it is shown that a Random Forest Classifier provides the best classification across most metrics, however the Extra Trees Classifier provided roughly equivalent performance with a speedup of 25%.
